\item A ladder, leaning against a wall, makes an angle of $60^{\degree}$ with the horizontal. If the foot of the ladder is $2.5m$ away from th    e wall, find the length of the ladder.

 \item As observed from the top of a light house, $100 m$  high above sea level, the angles of depression of a ship sailing directly towards it, change    s from $30^{\degree}$ to $60^{\degree}$. Find the distance travelled by the ship during the period of observation. (Use $\sqrt{3} = 1.73$).
